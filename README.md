**Apple released several updates for UIKit including the new ColorPicker**

**Grid** : <br />
The first view that shows up and allows to select colors from is a grid, with a range of colors being available as shown in the above image.

**Spectrum** : <br />
There are two additional ways to pick a color besides the grid. 
The first one is through the gradient color spectrum which is shown by tapping on the respective segment.

**Sliders** : <br />
The other way is by using RGB (red, green, blue) sliders in order to provide an exact RGB value, and on top of that there’s also a field where a color can be given as a hexadecimal value.

**Eyedropper tool button** : <br />
If you look at the top bar you’ll see an eyedropper tool button on the left.
When clicked, the color picker is temporarily dismissed, and it’s given the capability to select a color from the displayed screen content. 
Once selected, that color is then shown to the color picker. Interesting feature, especially on iPad.
